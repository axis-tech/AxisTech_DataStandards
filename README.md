Agricultural Data Standards  Guide - Australia (ADSGA) 
The Agricultural Data Standards Guide - Australia is a collaborative document aimed at making
agricultural data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) according to the FAIR data 
principles [1]. This guide was developed following the guidelines and steering policies of Agricultural 
Research Federation (AgReFed) [2] and should be interpreted as an application of their approach to 
the management and handling of agricultural data.
